### Call for Submissions
<!---
C3PO'20 Workshop - Compiler-assisted Correctness Checking and Performance
Optimization for HPC  
Thursday, June 25th, 2020  
Frankfurt, Germany  

Held in conjunction with ISC 2020.
--->

Compiler-assisted Correctness Checking and Performance Optimization for HPC (C3PO) workshop
co-located with ISC.
Frankfurt, Germany
June 25 2020

### Abstract
<!---
Practical compiler-enabled programming environments, applied analysis
methodologies, and end-to-end toolchains can contribute significantly to
performance portability in the exascale era. The practical and applied use of
compilation techniques, methods, and technologies, including static analysis
and transformation, are imperative to improve the performance, correctness, and
scalability of high-performance applications, middleware, and reusable
libraries.

This workshop brings together a diverse group of researchers with a shared
interest in applying compilation and source-to-source translation
methodologies, among others, to enhance explicit parallel programming such as
MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid models. These types of compiler technologies can also
be applied to heterogeneous programming elements including FPGAs and GPUs in
order to deliver higher achievable performance as compared to library-based
methods and hand-written approaches taken in isolation.

Original papers will identify and solve challenges in the tradeoffs of
scalability, performance, predictability, correctness, productivity, and
portability on-node and at massive scale; strong-scaling, weak-scaling, and
hybrid-scaling solutions assisted, augmented, and/or enabled by compiler
technology are in scope.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
correctness checking of parallel programs, source-to-source translation of
legacy MPI codes to improve performance-portability, instrumentation, and
massively multipass FPGA compiler optimization strategies.

We recognize that there are standard static analysis technologies (dataflow
analysis, polyhedral analysis, etc); this workshop seeks innovative
applications of such technologies singly and in combination to derive enhanced
utility in parallel programs that are generalizable beyond a single case study
or narrow application.

C3PO is a new workshop at the intersection of compilers/translators, HPC
middleware, and HPC applications. Practical compiler-enabled programming
environments, applied analysis methodologies, and end-to-end toolchains are
crucial to performance portability in the exascale era. The workshop brings
together researchers with a shared interest in applying compilation and
source-to-source translation methodologies to enhance parallel programming,
including explicit programming models such as MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid models.

### Submissions
C3PO solicits two kinds of papers. Full papers present novel and original
research and are limited to 12 pages in Springer LNCS format. Short papers
report on interesting new ideas, work with promising/early results, or
empirical studies and are limited to 6 pages in Springer LNCS format.

The review process is double blind. Each submission will receive at least three
reviews.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format on the submission website. The
organizers will make informal proceedings available online before the
conference. Authors may submit a revised version of the paper after the
workshop for printed proceedings. Authors of accepted papers will be required
to sign the Springer copyright form. Instructions for preparing papers for the
proceedings will be emailed to authors of accepted papers.
