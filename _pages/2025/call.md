# Call for Submissions


## Abstract
C3PO is a workshop at the intersection of compilers/translators, HPC
middleware, and HPC applications. Practical compiler-enabled programming
environments, applied analysis methodologies, and end-to-end toolchains are
crucial to performance portability in the exascale era. The workshop brings
together researchers with a shared interest in applying compilation and
source-to-source translation methodologies to enhance parallel programming,
including explicit programming models such as MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid models.

Original papers will identify and solve challenges in the tradeoffs of
scalability, performance, predictability, correctness, productivity, and
portability on-node and at massive scale. Strong-scaling, weak-scaling, and
hybrid-scaling solutions assisted, augmented, and/or enabled by compiler
technology are in scope.

We recognize that there are standard static analysis technologies (dataflow
analysis, polyhedral analysis, etc); this workshop seeks innovative
applications of such technologies to derive enhanced utility in parallel
programs that are generalizable beyond a single case study or narrow
application.

## Topics of Interest (but not limited to)
- Automatic parallelization
- Compilation for heterogeneous systems
- Compiler enabled optimization
- Compilation techniques for correctness checking of parallel software
- Cross-languages translation
- Modernization of legacy codes
- Source code instrumentation
- Source-to-source analysis/transformations
- Static analysis
- Static/dynamic interaction
- Compiler-based tooling for parallel application development 
- Artificial Intelligence applied to compilation techniques 

<!-- - Compiler-based tooling for parallel application development -->

## Submissions

C3PO solicits two kinds of papers. **Full papers** present novel and original
research and are limited to **12 pages** in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="blank">Springer LNCS format</a> (including references and appendices). **Short papers**
report on interesting new ideas, work with promising/early results, or
empirical studies and are limited to **6 pages** in <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="blank">Springer LNCS format</a>.

The review process is double blind. Each submission will receive at least three
reviews.

Papers must be submitted in PDF format on the submission website. The
organizers will make informal proceedings available online before the
conference. Authors may submit a revised version of the paper after the
workshop for printed proceedings. Authors of accepted papers will be required
to sign the Springer copyright form. Instructions for preparing papers for the
proceedings will be emailed to authors of accepted papers.
