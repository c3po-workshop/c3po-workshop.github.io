## Call for Papers

C3PO'20 Workshop - Compiler-assisted Correctness Checking and Performance
Optimization for HPC

Thursday, June 25th, 2020

Frankfurt, Germany

Held in conjunction with ISC 2020.

## Abstract
Practical compiler-enabled programming environments, applied analysis
methodologies, and end-to-end toolchains can contribute significantly to
performance portability in the exascale era. The practical and applied use of
compilation techniques, methods, and technologies, including static analysis
and transformation, are imperative to improve the performance, correctness, and
scalability of high-performance applications, middleware, and reusable
libraries.

This workshop brings together a diverse group of researchers with a shared
interest in applying compilation and source-to-source translation
methodologies, among others, to enhance explicit parallel programming such as
MPI, OpenMP, and hybrid models. These types of compiler technologies can also
be applied to heterogeneous programming elements including FPGAs and GPUs in
order to deliver higher achievable performance as compared to library-based
methods and hand-written approaches taken in isolation.

Original papers will identify and solve challenges in the tradeoffs of
scalability, performance, predictability, correctness, productivity, and
portability on-node and at massive scale; strong-scaling, weak-scaling, and
hybrid-scaling solutions assisted, augmented, and/or enabled by compiler
technology are in scope.  Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
correctness checking of parallel programs, source-to-source translation of
legacy MPI codes to improve performance-portability, instrumentation, and
massively multipass FPGA compiler optimization strategies.  

We recognize that there are standard static analysis technologies (dataflow
analysis, polyhedral analysis, etc); this workshop seeks innovative
applications of such technologies singly and in combination to derive enhanced
utility in parallel programs that are generalizable beyond a single case study
or narrow application.
